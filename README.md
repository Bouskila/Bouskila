## Hi, I’m Maor Bouskila 👋

Oracle ERP (EBS) techno-functional consultant with strong **PL/SQL** skills and hands-on experience in **Oracle EBS 11i/R12** and Oracle Cloud-related work.  
I build production-grade solutions: **validations, concurrent programs, integrations (REST APIs), reporting**, and support for business-critical flows.

### Focus Areas
- Oracle E-Business Suite: **OM / INV / PO** (end-to-end processes)
- **PL/SQL**: packages, performance, data fixes, validations
- Integrations: batch/file flows + **REST APIs** (Talend experience)
- **Oracle APEX**: application enhancements & operational support
- Reporting/BI: SQL-based reporting and data analysis

### Highlighted Work (Portfolio)
- **EBS Item Creation Automation** (PL/SQL + REST integration via Concurrent Program)  
- **APEX Distribution Management Tool** (spec + support, ~80% key-user time saved)  
- **Invoice Pricing Validation Rules** (prevents billing errors for specific subinventory flows)

### What I’m learning now
- English for technical interviews (daily practice)
- Modern integration patterns and clean documentation
- JavaScript basics (for APEX/UI and general tooling)
